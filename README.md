ATTIC is an e-commerce tool and online marketing platform that we've applied to the promotion of local shopping from small businesses in the Washington DC and Baltimore area. 

## Existing implementations
Our technology was first developed and deployed as [ATTIC DC](https://attic-dc.com/ "ATTIC DC") to promote local vintage and used furniture stores located in Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia. The site aggregates new inventory from more than 50 small businesses, including brick and mortar retailers and online dealers that sell a variety of furniture styles including [midcentury modern](https://attic-dc.com/browse#midcentury), [shabby chic](https://attic-dc.com/browse#farm), [industrial](https://attic-dc.com/browse#industrial), [art deco](https://attic-dc.com/browse#artdeco), [hollywood regency](https://attic-dc.com/browse#artdeco) and more.
