# ATTIC
ATTIC is an e-commerce tool and online marketing platform that we've applied to the promotion of local shopping from small businesses in the Washington DC and Baltimore areas. 

## Existing Implementations
Our technology was first developed and deployed as [ATTIC DC](https://attic-dc.com/browse "ATTIC DC") to promote local vintage and used furniture stores located in Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia. The site aggregates new inventory from more than [50 small businesses](https://attic-dc.com/stores), including brick and mortar retailers and online dealers that sell a variety of furniture styles including [midcentury modern](https://attic-dc.com/browse#midcentury), [shabby chic, farm and country](https://attic-dc.com/browse#country), [industrial](https://attic-dc.com/browse#industrial), [art deco](https://attic-dc.com/browse#artdeco), [hollywood regency](https://attic-dc.com/browse#artdeco) and more. The goal of the site was to make browsing and shopping from local stores and dealers easier. Prior to the release of ATTIC, obtaining similar information -- including product photographs, descriptions and prices -- required visiting more than 50 other online destinations. It was a slow and tedious process. Now thousands of users are taking advantage of ATTIC to streamline their furniture shopping experience.

In early 2016, we applied our same technology to two new shopping verticals: vintage curios and oddities as [ATTIC Flea](https://flea.attic-dc.com/browse), and a blend of new and vintage clothing from local clothing boutiques as [ATTIC Fashion](https://fashion.attic-dc.com/browse). The latter demonstrated how we could move into a new product niche with relative ease.
