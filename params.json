  "body": "# ATTIC\r\nATTIC is an e-commerce tool and online marketing platform that we've applied to the promotion of local shopping from small businesses in the Washington DC and Baltimore areas. \r\n\r\n## Existing Implementations\r\nOur technology was first developed and deployed as [ATTIC DC](https://attic-dc.com/browse \"ATTIC DC\") to promote local vintage and used furniture stores located in Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia. The site aggregates new inventory from more than [50 small businesses](https://attic-dc.com/stores), including brick and mortar retailers and online dealers that sell a variety of furniture styles including [midcentury modern](https://attic-dc.com/browse#midcentury), [shabby chic, farm and country](https://attic-dc.com/browse#country), [industrial](https://attic-dc.com/browse#industrial), [art deco](https://attic-dc.com/browse#artdeco), [hollywood regency](https://attic-dc.com/browse#artdeco) and more. The goal of the site was to make browsing and shopping from local stores and dealers easier. Prior to the release of ATTIC, obtaining similar information -- including product photographs, descriptions and prices -- required visiting more than 50 other online destinations. It was a slow and tedious process. Now thousands of users are taking advantage of ATTIC to streamline their furniture shopping experience.\r\n\r\nIn early 2016, we applied our same technology to two new shopping verticals: vintage curios and oddities as [ATTIC Flea](https://flea.attic-dc.com/browse), and a blend of new and vintage clothing from local clothing boutqiues as [ATTIC Fashion](https://fashion.attic-dc.com/browse). The latter demonstrated how we could move into a new product niche with relative ease. \r\n\r\n## Media and Press Coverage\r\n**Popville**, \"[After 37 years, 3 owners, 6 locations, & thousands of happy customers; Ruff & Ready will no longer maintain a brick & mortar location in DC](http://www.popville.com/2016/10/ruff-ready-closing-dc/)\", Oct 28, 2016. \r\n\r\n**BrightestYoungThings**, \"[Startups To Start Noticing: ATTIC DC](http://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/startups-to-start-noticing-attic-dc)\", August 31, 2016. \r\n\r\n**Washingtonian Magazine**, \"[13 Places to Shop for Vintage Furniture in Washington](https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/08/09/shop-vintage-furniture-washington-dc/)\", August 9, 2016. \r\n\r\n**The Washington Post**, \"[A vintage-furniture aficionado calls Petworth home](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-opinions-are-local/wp/2016/03/22/a-vintage-furniture-aficionado-calls-petworth-home/)\", March 22, 2016 \r\n\r\n**Petworth News**, \"[A vintage-furniture aficionado calls Petworth home](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-opinions-are-local/wp/2016/03/22/a-vintage-furniture-aficionado-calls-petworth-home/)\", March 21, 2016 \r\n\r\n**Washingtonian Magazine**, \"[10 Beautiful Nightstands You’ll Actually Want to Keep Clutter Free. And where you can find them in DC.](http://www.washingtonian.com/2016/03/16/10-beautiful-nightstands-and-where-to-find-them-in-dc/)\", March 16, 2016. \r\n\r\n**Popville**, \"[Hunted House closing on H Street – An Interview with the Owner from ATTIC DC](http://www.popville.com/2016/02/hunted-house-closing-hstne-dc/)\", February 3, 2016 \r\n\r\n**Cloudinary**, \"[10 Startups managing images in the cloud - Part 7](http://cloudinary.com/blog/10_startups_managing_images_in_the_cloud_part_7)\", December 17, 2015 \r\n\r\n**Popville**, \"[Millennium Decorative Arts closing on U Street at the End of the Year – An Interview with the Owner by ATTIC DC](http://www.popville.com/2015/11/millennium-decorative-arts-closing-on-u-street-at-the-end-of-the-year-an-interview-with-the-owner-by-attic-dc/)\", November 18, 2015 \r\n\r\n**Awesome Foundation (DC Chapter),** [July 2015 Grant Winner](http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/50067-attic-dc) \r\n\r\n**Washingtonian**, \"[This Brilliant New Website Finds the Best Vintage Furniture in DC for You](http://www.washingtonian.com/2015/07/15/this-brilliant-new-website-finds-the-best-vintage-furniture-in-dc-for-you/)\", July 15, 2015 \r\n\r\n**The Washington Post**, \"[The search for vintage furniture, made easier](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/the-search-for-vintage-furniture-made-easier/2015/06/09/a913c7e6-0b98-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html)\", June 9, 2015 \r\n\r\n**Elevation DC**, \"[New site Attic aims to help you find that perfect piece of furniture and support a local business](http://www.elevationdcmedia.com/innovationnews/attic_060415.aspx)\", June 4, 2015\r\n\r\n## Technology\r\nForthcoming\r\n\r\n## Business Model\r\nForthcoming\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\nForthcoming\r\n\r\nFor more information, see our case studies about [ATTIC](https://technotarek.com/case-studies/attic) and [ATTIC Fashion](https://technotarek.com/case-studies/attic-fashion).\r\n",
